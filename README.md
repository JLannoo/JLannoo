I'm a fullstack web developer from Argentina.

I like making stuff and hoping it's good. Most of the time, it's not.

I also like learning a lot a of things, like game modding ([two of my game](https://github.com/JLannoo/HaveIDonated) [modding projects](https://github.com/JLannoo/CookieAnalyzer)) and IoT stuff ([got some smart lights and they](https://github.com/JLannoo/wiz-lights-manager) [didn't have a desktop app](https://github.com/JLannoo/wiz-lights-manager-desktop)).

Currently I'm learning about:
- Go
- Electron
- C# (kinda)
